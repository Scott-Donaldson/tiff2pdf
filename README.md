# Tiff to PDF Converter
### Mass Converting Software
###
This Software detects all TIFF Files in a given directory then outputs them all as PDF's, Automatically converting them.

It creates duplicates of all files and only copies the files, not directly editing them so you still have the originals available for future use.

As I dont use TIFF or PDF Files often there are bound to be bugs as I dont have that many TIFF Files on hand other then the examples one I had to make sure it worked. 

This is nothing special, just an intuitive, easy to use tool to make your life a little easier!
